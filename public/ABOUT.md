# GBIF eDNA Publishing Tool

A tool for preparing eDNA datasets shaped as OTU/ASV tables for publication to GBIF.

## Overall idea

1. web-based interface/tool that lets researchers (or other) publish an eDNA metabarcoding dataset to GBIF
Minimal preparation/reformatting required
2. Standardise and automate important steps to ensure interoperability with other datasets
3. Compliance with community standards
4. Include as many immediate benefits as long as they easily implemented
5. Prioritize fast and easy publication and online visibility (and later curation, correction) as opposed to a tedious publishing process with many steps and choices
